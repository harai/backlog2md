# Hatena Markup for Blogger

A Writing Environment for advanced Blogger users.

## Overview

This is a User Script (Greasemonkey Script) which works on administration pages of Blogger, Google's blog service.

With this script, you can write blog posts much quicker using **Hatena Markup**, a markup language specialized for blog posts.

## What is Hatena Markup?

Hatena Markup is a markup language originally created by **Hatena**, a Japanese company which provides a blog service called **Hatena Diary**.

For Japanese programmers, it was without a doubt the most popular blog service in Japan, because there were lots of care to please geeks.  And Hatena Markup was one of them.

## Why not use Markdown?

You might think I should use Markdown instead of Hatena Markup.

Though it is true Markdown is much more popular than Hatena Markup, the purpose is a little bit different.  While Hatena Markup was designed to reduce typing when writing blog posts, Markdown was designed to retain readability.

Because no one except the writer reads the original text full of strange symbols, adopting Hatena Markup is a better decision.
